/*
 * This is one of the testing array interview questions, which often proved
 * tricky for Java programmers. Well, you can also reverse an array in place
 * without using an additional buffer. If you know how to access array elements
 * and how to loop over an array in Java using traditional for loop, you can
 * easily solve this problem without using additional space. All you need to do
 * is loop over the array from start to the middle element and swap first
 * element to the last, second element to the second last etc. Once you reach
 * the middle element, your array is already sorted and that too without using
 * any additional space.
